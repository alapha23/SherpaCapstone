VALUES (1, 1, 'This paper explores the impact of urban parks on real estate prices making use of a hedonic price approach. Focusing on Brisbane, Australia, as a case study site, we use spatial hedonic models to analyse housing sales data across 15,000 sales transactions to investigate the effects of parks on nearby housing prices, paying attention to park typology and classification. Our findings indicate that recreational and sport parks are differently associated with price variations. The study also examines a specific and significant inner-city park currently undergoing a major redevelopment-namely Victoria Park. Our analysis of the Victoria Park site seeks to quantify the value uplift, that is, the future increase in property prices as a result of the transformation of the current private golf course in this location into a new publicly accessible parkland. This study’s property economics modelling analysis indicates the conversion of Victoria Park from a golf course to public parkland will increase property prices by an average of 3 % for properties located within 750 m of the park. The article concludes with a dis\x02cussion of value capture opportunities that these findings present as well as challenges of green gentrification for this and similar urban renewal projects and possible policy responses.This paper explores the impact of urban parks on real estate prices making use of a hedonic price approach.

'Urban green space can refer to different typologies of areas, characterized by various functions and degrees of naturalness, such as urban parks and gardens, outdoor sports areas, school gardens, grassland and wetlands. Irrespective of their characterization, urban green areas provide a variety of benefits to the population, which range from the opportunity to spend time in nature and enjoy aesthetically pleasing landscapes to environmental benefits such as improvement in air quality, water run-off regulation, conservation of biodiversity, and so on (Chiesura, 2004). More generally, it has been recognized that urban green space offers a wide range of ecosystem services, including biophysical, environmental, cultural, and perceptive dimensions (Andersson et al., 2015; Bolund and Hunhammar, 1999; Wiggering et al., 2006). Additionally, many economic benefits are associated with urban green areas and, more generally, with environmental goods and services (Ambrey and Fleming, 2014; Bertram and Rehdanz, 2015). It is well known that the use and transformation of environmental systems have been shown to have a variety of economic effects and repercussions, to the extent that the environment is considered a key (positive or negative) externality within the urban economics literature (Palmquist, 2005). In light of the growing importance of environmental factors in urban and land economics, specific evaluation tools have been developed that allow the value of the environment and urban green spaces to be estimated in order to establish and assess the foreseeable benefits of certain actions involving their use and transformation (van der Heide and Heijman, 2013).',

'The majority of studies on economic valuation of urban green spaces employ a Total Economic Value (TEV) approach (Pearce and Turner, 1990; Harnik, 2014). The TEV approach is based on the assumption that any good or service is composed of various attributes, some of which are concrete and easily measured, while others may be more difficult to quantify. The overall value of the good or service is given by the sum of all of these components. Different evaluation techniques are available for estimating the TEV. According to Pearce and Turner (1990), the methods can be divided into two main families: i) Revealed preferences methods, that derive the value of an environmental and landscape resource from the observation of individuals’ decisions in real markets. These methods include Travel Cost Method (Voke et al., 2013) and Hedonic Pricing method (Freeman III et al., 2014); ii) Stated preferences methods, that are based on the creation of a simulated market data collection by asking individuals for their Willingness To Pay (WTP) for using a certain good or service, or Willingness To Accept (WTA) abandoning a certain good.

'This study builds the established TEV methodological framework and extends it by applying a hedonic pricing methodology to explore the effect of urban parks on real estate prices in the city of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In recent years, different studies have highlighted that the presence of urban parks positively affects the price of apartments in the surrounding areas. In particular, the use of the Hedonic Modelling approach allows researchers to estimate the value of environmental amenities by appraising the role of proximity to urban parks in the determination of the price of real estate (Morancho, 2003; Jim and Chen, 2006). While it has been demonstrated that proximity to urban green areas plays an important role in the determination of housing prices in surrounding areas, the impact of the specific characteristics of urban parks-including their physical features, spatial context, and typology-has been less explored (Kim et al. 2019; Czembrowski and Kronemberg, 2016; Holt and Borsuk, 2020). In order to fill this gap, the present paper investigates how proximity to urban parks affects housing prices in the city of Brisbane in terms of increase in property values, focusing in particular on the value uplift associated with the different park characteristics and typologies. Beyond the benefits delivered by urban parks, the article also discusses the negative social impacts that these areas produce in terms of gentrification, in that the added value to housing created by urban greening interventions leads to higher rental prices, and thus can result in the displacement of economically vulnerable residents (Anguelovski et al., 2018).',

'Starting from this premise, the objective of the article is twofold. First, it aims to provide an exploration of the effect of urban parks on housing prices in the city of Brisbane, according to the different park typologies. Second, drawing on the results of the empirical model and considering the transformation of a private 18-hole golf course into a publicly accessible parkland, the paper quantifies the potential impact on the surrounding real estate properties, thus providing the first estimation of the value uplift associated with the development of this urban park. The impact of the presence of the new park in terms of increase in housing prices is also discussed from the point of view of possible green gentrification effects that could negatively impact the area under examination. The study will be of interest to urban greening researchers, property valuers, and decision makers involved in the planning and management of urban green renewal projects, as its findings (a) demonstrate an approach for quantifying both the value uplift and associated urban ecosystem services provided by urban parks and (b) contribute to debates surrounding the issue of green gentrification.',

'The importance of quantifying the value of non-market goods can be explained by the increasing demands on natural capital and ecosystems services on our urbanized planet (Guo et al., 2010) and the need for people to live in an inclusive, healthy, resilient, safe and sustainable environment (Loh et al, 2020; Yigitcanlar et al, 2019; Bottero et al., 2020; Caprioli et al. 2021). Many scholars point to the role and benefit of natural capital to improve human well-being, social cohesion, and social inclusion, both qualitatively and quantitatively (Bertram and Rehdanz, 2015; Dennis and James, 2016; Ekins, 2003; Jim and Chen, 2009). A special attention has been devoted in the literature to the analysis of natural capital in exploring the relationship between urban green spaces and property valuation (Jones et al., 2019; Valente et al. 2020; Ekins, 2003). In particular, the Hedonic Price Method – HPM (Rosen, 1974) has been widely applied to estimate the contribution to property values delivered by environmental amenities (Crompton, 2001). Indeed, since Ridker and Henning (1967) found that hedonic pricing models are statistically significant in the context of environmental economics, increasing attention has been given to the evaluation of externalities generated by natural resources and environmental amenities and their effect on house prices (Geoghegan, Wainger, and Bockstael, 1997; McLeod, 1984). In recent years, the availability of urban data and advances in geo-statistics have made valuation studies of urban green spaces more and more important (Holt and Borsuk, 2020). The rationale behind HPM is that the house is a composite good and its value is determined by multiple characteristics, including tangible housing elements (e.g., surface, floor, state of conservation, etc.) and intangible elements (e.g., landscape quality, environmental services, etc.). Accordingly, the hedonic function allows a marginal price of each characteristic to be assigned, leading to a monetary estimation of each housing attribute. ',

'An analysis of the literature shows the ongoing interest in the adoption of this approach for estimating the value of environmental externalities (Sirmans et al., 2006). Recent publications analyse, among other factors, the spillover effects related to ecological lands and landscape proximity (Xiao et al., 2019), waterfronts (Dahal et al., 2019), urban rivers (Chen et al., 2019), forests (Lamhamedi et al. 2021), the flood risks perception (Sado-Inamura and Fukushi, 2019), environmental amenities across space (Hiebert and Allen, 2019), preference between detention and retention ponds (Sohn et al. 2020), and the impact of multimodal accessibility to green space (Chen et al. 2021). With specific reference to the value of urban green areas, Kong et al. (2007) pointed out that for the city of Jinan (China) a 1 % improvement in accessibility to parks will lead to an increase in housing price per square meter of 1.6 %. Analogously, for the city of Salo (Finland), Tyrvainen and Miettinen (2000) found that individuals are willing to pay 4.9 % more for houses with a forest view. An analysis of Turin (Italy) illustrates how the quality of the area, including proximity to green areas, affects in a positive way the value of a property (D’Acci, 2014). Dell’Anna et al (2022) expressly analysed the impact of green infrastructures on housing prices in the city of Singapore, pointing out the existence of an influence of city parks, regional parks, and nature areas on apartment values. Specific studies by Kim et al., 2019, Nur et al., 2020 and Piaggio, 2021 in the cities of Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and San Jos´e(Costa Rica), respectively, explore the role of size and characteristics of the urban green areas in the determination of the prices. Cheung and Fernandez (2021) examine the different effects of three categories of green spaces (i.e. urban parks, regional reserves and volcanic parks) on residential property transactions in Auckland (New Zealand). Several studies that analyse the effects of urban greening, including greenbelts, urban tree programs and creation of parks, on property values, indicate that buyers appreciate the importance of living in neighbourhoods with greener and denser vegetation (Jun and Kim, 2017; Li et al., 2019; Payton et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2020). In another study focused on the city of Stockholm, the negative influence of crimes in parks on apartment prices is estimated (Iqbal and Wilhelmsson, 2018).',

'With specific reference to urban parks, Table 1 details the most recent applications that investigate the application of HPM for estimating the spillovers effects of this typology of areas. As far as the city of Brisbane is concerned, the analysis of the literature highlights a number of applications of HPM for estimating the effects of different urban goods and services, including transport infrastructures, urban forestry and flood control. In particular, Table 2 details the main fields of research of these studies with a focus on the characteristic variables used for the implementation of the different HPM approaches. Our literature review substantiates the novelty of the research described in this article fourfold: (1) It is the first local application of an HPM valuation on the effects of urban parks on property values in the city of Brisbane. (2) An additional element of innovation of this study is related to the fact that the characteristics of the parks are considered in the estimation of the effects on housing pricing. (3) The paper’s originality is further corroborated by the study’s development of the evaluation following the approach of the spatial hedonic models, an implementation of the traditional HPM that is receiving more and more attention in the real estate appraisal (LeSage and Pace, 2009; Krause and Bitter, 2012; Bottero et al., 2018). (4) Finally, the effects of urban parks in terms of increases in property values are also discussed with regards to the possible impacts of green gentrification.
